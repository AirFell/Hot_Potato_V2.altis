-Ok. The method for changing classes is garbage. Instead, change uniform, then change the store checks
to what uniform they're wearing.
NOTE: For engineer's with this method we'll need a custom addaction for repairing vehicles.
When players purchase the engineer kit, we give them another addaction to repair/flip vehicles.
IF's-
	wearing the right uniform(mind player sides)
	in distance from a vehicle

add "ending" to resource missions- make new ones spawn.

check bases for accuracy on map. Some are jacked up.

add some side-neutral cash-only shops.

finish off base-related dialogs.

clear fortification objects from vehicle spawn areas so people can't trap people

tutorial dialog on addaction for explaining the game

money system/scoring system- event handlers of some sort?
	points for wounding enemy players when friendly finishes them off
	points for destroying enemy vehicles

get into using automated RCON

add custom loading screen?
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Polish things for later:
how many times will a base be destroyed?(Should we make more base spawn markers?)

pretty up closing end-mission things.
	-Idea: stop player movement and then force everyone into a camera that spawns near the last destroyed tower, then "endMission"
check crew placement on attach bomb addaction

Change functions to complilefinal. Holy shit thats going to be hard.

Variables that need to be adjusted for gameplay:
Bomb marker timer: server\Bomb_Marker.sqf line 2
Bomb arm addaction range of enemy base: client\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 92
Bomb arm range of enemy base: clinet\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 9
Duration of arming animation: client\Arm_Bomb.sqf line 17
Duration of disarming animation: client\Diarm_Bomb.sqf line 9
Length of Countdown Timer: server\Bomb_Countdown_Detonate.sqf line 9
Range of Damage from "explosion": server\Bomb_Countdown_Detonate.sqf line 21
Bomb respawn delay: server\BombRespawn.sqf line 9
